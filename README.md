# developing_Games
A Purdue School project 

The file dg_website is a project I did with my fellow students at Purdue University. Dg stands for Developing Games and itâ€™s a website that was to be used to have us review games that are in development or are finished but have updates that change a large portion of the game. I along with another individual form my group created the entirety of the functionality of the website along with its CSS. The theme, coloring, and Logo were created by our other members.
