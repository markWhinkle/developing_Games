			<p>I’m 19 years old. I like anime and animals. My first video game was pokémon Diamond.
			I got it when I was eight , and my starter was turtwig. I like to collect cards in my spare time.
			I also like to stare into the void and slowly slip into the madness that will eventually consume my entire
			being. I am also afraid of spider and earwigs.

			<p>Hello! I am a big fan of Nintendo franchises, Mystery Games, and oddball Indie titles. I like to complete games to the fullest,
				especially in RPG and adventure games, as well as exploring everything there is to mystery games, including lore, scenery, and
				outside entries in the games' stories. I would definitely consider myself a Completionist. Growing up with Nintendo games and consoles,
				I have played almost every mainstream franchise of theirs, and love to play both new and old releases of their games.

			<p>I'm 19 years old and i'm a huge fan of videogames. Videogames are my life, I play them all the time
			so I have alot of knowledge about them. I play mostly horror related games like Friday the 13th the game
			and Dead by Daylight. Best killer is obviously clown so fight me if you want to argue about it. I'm currently
			majoring in game development so I can make games later on in my life.</p>

			<p>Hi there! I'm a 19-year-old student at Purdue University majoring in Game Development and Design. Video games and computers have been a huge interest of mine, spending plenty of time playing with friends and family since I was a kid.
			I find the stories and world-building within games very interesting as I am a huge fan of RPG games such as The Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age, as well as shooters and even classics like Megaman, too.
			Growing up with a love for games and devoting so much time to them, I think Developing Games could help new and old gamers alike find new experiences to enjoy in the community.

			<p>Hello! I'm a Game Design and Development major at Purdue, and I've had an interest in video games for as long as I can remember.
			My favorite types of games are the smaller titles that you may find on a whim, but the dedication and passion put into them keeps you
			coming back for hours. I think a service like Developing Games could really let these types of games shine, and I would love to help
			them in reaching the audience they truly deserve!</p>

			<p>Howdy! I am a double major of Web Design and Development and Game Design and Development at Purdue University. Ever since I was just a young
				chap I have had an interest in video games. I really enjoy games with a big emphasis on story and combat. I think the most enjoyable games
				are the ones who tell an interesting story with solid game mechanics to back them up. We created this website to help gamers and hobbyists learn
				which games are really enjoyble from the perspective of people just like them. We also hope that with knowing what are group likes and how we would rate
				certain games, that it would help people know how reliable our reviews are.
