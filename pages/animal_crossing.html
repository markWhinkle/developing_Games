          <h2>Animal Corssing New Horizons Review</h2>
          <h5>Jack, Apr 30, 2020</h5>

          <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the newest installment in the series, and the updates made to the game are very impressive. Fans both old and new are loving the stellar visuals, fun gameplay, and brand-new features this game has to offer. However, the question remains not only if this is the better than Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but the animal crossing franchise as a whole? Let’s get started with the pros of the game.</p>
          <p>To start the improvements off let’s talk about the big drive of the game: the island customization. Not only can you now place any item you want outside on your island, but you can even move building and terraform the island to make it look exactly the way you want it to. Not only that, getting the villagers you want is made much more efficient and effective. Now, you get to choose exactly where a villager moves, meaning no more instances of villagers moving into your flower gardens like in previous titles. Not only that, villagers will no longer move out unless you give them the approval to move out, which means you can have your dream island and not be forced to play all the time. Also, the randomness factor of who moves into your town was drastically improved thanks to the new Mystery Tours. Replacing the island tour from New Leaf, New Horizons features island tours, which transports the player to one of a large variety of islands that offer many benefits to them. These benefits include much larger fish spawns, making the rare fish much easier to catch, bamboo islands to collect bamboo for your town, and islands that consists solely of money rocks. Alongside all these great features to the island, a villager will always be at an island if you have a plot open, making it much easier to get the villagers you want to move into your town. Getting to the new islands requires the player to use a secondary form of currency: Nook Mile Tickets, which are a great addition to the game. For achieving the in game milestones, as well as completing various simple tasks, the player is rewarded with these Nook Miles, which can be used to purchase the aforementioned Tickets, as well as various

          collectables and utilities to make your island life much better, including an upgraded inventory to 40 slots from the previous games limited 15 slots, as well as a new tool wheel to help make tool navigation much easier and less tedious. The other new feature this game added was crafting, which is a welcome addition to the series. The recipes can help create a variety of tools, furniture, or other miscellaneous items such as fish bait, which is singlehandedly one of the best additions to the game. This makes collecting all the fish infinitely easier, as you can guarantee spawns in specific locations. Storage was brought back from New Leaf, and it was made even better with more space and easier navigation. The Nintendo Switch Online app actually has functions in the game, such as messaging quickly and enhanced designs, which is a complete upgrade from the previous entries. The Nook Phone is a very convenient navigation service that allows easy access to numerous features in the game. Various other minor additions make the game all the better, such as new flowers, higher bell scaling, and enhanced graphics, making locations like the museum look better than ever. All of these factors help create a new and distinct animal crossing game that sticks out from its predecessors.
          </p><p>However, this is not the perfect game that fans were looking for, as there are various other changes to the game that make it a worse experience. Many of the problems stem from one word: Tedium. The many additions to the game are incredibly tedious, such as the one at a time crafting system, the cutscenes that play out every time the player wants to edit the island terrain, and the NPCs suffer from this more than anyone. It takes roughly 3 minutes of dialogue and cutscenes to connect to a friend’s island over the internet, and the morning announcements always have Isabelle talking about useless information when she doesn’t need to say anything because nothing is happening. It’s charming the first dew times you see it, but it slowly grates on the player. The new features are very unique in concept but are executed terribly. The new tool
          system is a prime example: Every tool in this game breaks, including the golden ones. This makes those quality of life improvements useless because you have to either stock up on multiple tools or constantly backtrack to the store or other crafting tables, as well as have the various materials in your inventory. Speaking of the store, everything in this game is unlockable, and the progression system once again feels tedious. It takes a minimum of at least a week to unlock the town hall, which makes the early stages of the game very boring as there isn’t much to do. There also isn’t much to do afterwards, as there is no main street or city to visit, making the island life really the only thing to do. There are various other features that have seemingly little to do in the game, such as the Rescue Service, Harv’s Island, and even the villagers with the same dialogue they share with other villagers of the same personality. The seasonal events were added recently, or at least some of them because the game doesn’t have all of the seasons or special characters programmed into the game. Not only that, the seasons are tedious, overlapping with other events such as cherry blossom season and Easter, and last for far longer than anyone wants. The special characters aren’t the only ones not in the game, as many of the characters aren’t in the game, or at least not initially. This offers a barren feeling in the environment, as well as the lack of shops. There are only 5 buildings in the game, and only 2 of them upgrade a single time. These is a downgrade from past games, as at the very least the shop would upgrade around 4 times. These are features that feel like downgrades from previous games, which makes this game not stand out in the best ways amongst the other games.
          All in all, the game adds a lot but also takes out a lot of features. It definitely is a game worth playing, especially during the current day circumstances. The game adds many new features, making it the ideal game for creative minds, but not as ideal for fans who want to collect the achievements and meet all the special characters.</p>
