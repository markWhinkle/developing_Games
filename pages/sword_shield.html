          <h2>Pokemon Sword and Shield Review</h2>
          <h5>Devyn, April 30, 2020</h5>

          <p>Pokémon sword and shield has little to add to the Pokémon video game series. Dynamaxing and giganticmaxing are lame mechanics. They don’t really add much to the game and the only time you can ever use them is in a gym battle, which once you complete the main storyline you can’t challenge anymore. You can fight Dynamax Pokémon in the wild areas, which you can giganticmax your pokémon to fight them, but it’s used more as a way to exp farm and takes too long to do. Also you have to fight with other people, which makes it very hard since if you don’t wanna buy a subscription to use your own Wi-Fi you just have to do with the NPC‘s in the games which are very weak and tend to lose the battle for you. The wild plains itself was promised to be open world mechanic which it does not do very well all.  The trees look terrible and you can only see wild Pokémon when you’re right on top of them which is very annoying. Normally in a Pokémon game you can see the entire area you were in , but in this game it is constantly buffering. Like as you move then things start to show up . Say  there was a Pokémon right in front of you, you wouldn’t see it unless you are right in front of it. It is very annoying if you’re trying to avoid Pokémon. The bike mechanic in past games allowed you to go as fast as you want as long as you want but this game it has a cool down so you could only go fast for 10 seconds and then you have to wait another 10 seconds to go fast again which is inefficient. The graphics aren’t very good.  It was greatly implied that the graphics would be at the top quality since this would be on a brand new console the Nintendo switch. However, they are basically the same as they were in the 3DS. Also not all Pokémon are in the game like some were left out because they said there wasn’t enough storage.
          It was proven that they had even more than enough storage to put 1000 more Pokémon than they already created so it was just more for greed due to the fact they created Pokémon HOME which is supposed to hold all the Pokémon in it for you. So you don’t have to put them all in the game because they don’t exist in the game. If I had to say a good thing about the game I would say the new Pokémon. Not all of are good, but Galarian Rapidash and the legendary dogs are cool.</p>
