          <h2>Doom (2016) Review</h2>
          <h5>Mark G, Apr 30, 2020</h5>

		  <p><strong>Doom Guy is back for some good ol' ass-kickin'!</strong></p>

          <p>Considering the last time we saw him in action was in 2004 appearing as a simple marine, I was shocked like many fans to hear that a new iteration would be cranked out for 2016. The game was first annonced in 2008 as <i>Doom 4</i>, then again in 2014 signaling the series was undergoing a transformation by going back to its roots, all while adding some juicy new elements to the game. The game's launch was met with great reception, receiving an 85/100 on <i>Metacritic</i>, a 7.1/10 from <i>IGN</i>, and four-and-a-half stars out of five from <i>GameRevolution</i>. Overall, <i>Doom 2016</i> was a major success that brought new brevity and excitement to a series that fans had thought lost. With its over-the-top gore, nail-grinding speed, and explosive environment that encourages exploration and all-out slaughter, this game surely brought the series back to the forefront of leading games.</p>
		  <p><i>Doom</i> brings with it a breath of fresh air that players can feel right out of the gate. While plenty of games these days try to hand-hold you through tiring tutorials and exposition, <i>Doom</i> tries a different approach by throwing you into the flames head first through the door to an unkown world (literally). The doom guy, you the player, finds himself awake and immediately at odds with the minions of Hell having been released by scientists at the UAC. And of course, he deals with them the only he knows: by putting the undead and unholy back in their graves. <i>Doom</i> makes sure to grab your interest from the beginning, giving you the time and adrenaline to figure out the best way of killing demons and finding your way around Mars. Not only that, but the fun never seems to stop from beginning to end, introducing new guns, foes, and challenges along the way. Whether it be exploring the nooks and crannies of the map or the satisfaction of earning every upgrade available to better deal out justice to your enemies, the game surely has something for everyone.</p>

		  <p>If you're more into story telling and a fleshed-out plot, then I may have some bad news for you. While <i>Doom</i> certainly has a story to tell about humanity's flaws and our search for a solution for reliable energy, it's not so much focused on building a thriving universe fully of plot as it is giving the player a sense of direction and purpose, letting them rip and tear their way through each of the 13 levels. Some people may find the plot lacking, and others may find that the developer's simply wanted to return to the roots of the original game. In either case, the UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) who is in charge of the operation on Mars has its story slowly unveiled along with the history of Hell and the Doom Guy's relation to it all. The environment for this story, however, is not so alive as we may feel it should. Of course, the favility on Mars would have had huge casulties following the destruction from the Hell spawn. However, with the only humanoid characters being a robot, and AI, and a half-cyborg woman being the antagonist, it is hard to true humanity on Mars. It certainly is still an alien place.</p>

		  <p>Okay, so how exactly does the game fair through its use of mechanics and the content of its levels? Well, this is where the game excels. From the destroyed research facility to the inner circles of Hell, each level is uniquely crafted. Starting out with a mere pistol shotgun, the game allows you to learn how to navigate around enemies, showing the player how the game is meant to be played: with enough movement and violence that one can give against the multiple waves of enemies to be destroyed.</p>

		  <p>Most likely seeking to resolve the complaints of <i>Doom 3</i>'s flaws of slow progression and fearful exploration, 2016's version no longer allows the player any time to slowly creep around corners with their trusty flash light. In this game, movement and the consistent replenishing of health and ammo are key to the player's survival. This playstyle is reinforced even more with powerups that grant players even more unnatural strength, speed and agility, but also through the game's most satisfying mechanic of all: glory kills. Gone are the days of cowering behind cover or encouraging players to stay far away in first-person shooters. The rewards of glory kills make it more reasonable, more enjoyable to get up close and personal with the most dangerous creatures on Mars. Each one performed rewards you with health pickups essential for the player's survival, as well as other boosts available through runes acquired by completely challenges throughout the game. Not only are glory kills a new fan-favorite, but they are even cooler when considering the variety of moves possibly for each minion based on where you melee them from. What's better than exploding a demon with an explosive barrel to watch them shoot off in pieces? Beating them with their own arm until they die.</p>

		  <p>One thing should be plainly obvious at this point: <i>Doom</i> is not for the feint of heart. To further prove this, the developer's want you to feel as if you were truly fending off the hordes of Hell when it comes to difficulty. Available in the modes of "I'm Too Young to Die," "Hurt Me Plenty," "Ultra-Violence," and later "Nightmare," and even "Ultra-Nightmare," the campaign doesn't pull any punches. Beating it on Nightmare alone is a feat worth boasting about, but beating it in a single life?! Now that's one hell of a nightmare, available only through the setting of Ultra-Nightmare. The beautifully-created graphics are accentuated even more after learning to recognize and appreciate each enemy's movements, characteristics, and details while progressing through the game. Over time, it becomes apparent just how much thought and love went into creating the creatures, how they interact with you the player, and the roles of every little thing on the map, not to mention the awesome little collectibles that you can find hidden here and there.</p>

		  <p>When rating <i>Doom</i> and how how good of a creation it is, the history and mechanics are essential to the world it tries to create. A game with such momentous and fun-filled foundations has to do things in a way that pleases new and old gamers alike. <i>Doom</i> does this in a way I've never seen any other title do so before. It's not afraid to pull the rug out from under you, to stray away from the structure that is widely accepted by gamers today. Instead, it makes you think about how to succeed all while feeling like a superhero. Games these days can be very preachy, boring, or even downright frustrating. They too much story, too little action, or maybe not enough excitement to keep us coming back for more. While it certainly has flaws in its story and repetitive nature, <i>Doom</i> consistently provides enough fun to keep players coming back for more demon slaying. Whether you consider yourself a more casual gamer or a hardcore one, <i>Doom</i> certainly has a way to give a great experience, even if it's only through the use of an awesome soundtrack.</p>
