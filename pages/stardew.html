          <h2>Stardew Valley Review</h2>
          <h5>Devyn, April 30, 2020</h5>

          <p>Stardew Valley is a great game. While this game does have some magical elements about it. It is mainly set in the real world. Not our world mind you, but a similar one. The game starts with you receiving a letter from your grandpa stating that you have inherited his farm. You can do whatever you want with the farm. You could raise animals, grow crops, fish, or fight monsters. Being able to fight monsters depends on which farm you chose in the beginning of the game, but there are mines where you can always fight monsters. The ambience and sound effects in the game are really good. Like if you get a horse wherever you ride it you hear it’s hooves make the appropriate clopping noise. The background noise is very nice music, but it doesn’t last too long so it doesn’t get annoying. A main part of the game is you being able to form personal relationships with the characters in the game. They all have back stories and ,depending on how good of friends you are with them, you learn more about them and what their lives are like which I thought was really cool. All the characters are pretty likable and you can even marry most of them. I really like that you can be gay or straight in this game because most games don’t give you that option. In other games depending on what gender you choose in the beginning of the game makes it so you can only fall in love with someone of the opposite gender which always kinda sucked. All the animals you can get are pretty neat and you don’t kill any of them which I thought was nice. Like you can get a pig and I originally thought you would have to kill the pig but pigs give you truffles which is a nice way around that type of expectation.
          I also really like the graphics this is more personal, but I like pixel graphics and this does it really well.No Game is perfect and this game does has its flaws. Its main flaw would be that the days are really quick. There is always a lot to do and so you wish you had more time but the problem is if you stay out too late you’ll pass out and you might lose some of your items. Also the next day you’ll have half the energy to do stuff. Each day is about 13 minutes real time, so you have to plan ahead to know what you’re going to do that day and you can’t waste much time. If you don’t have the horse you can’t really go to many places because it takes a long time to run there. Otherwise I’d say that’s about it.</p>
